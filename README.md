# A simple Docker container that helps me with solving CTF Challenges
My old nix shell broke, i am on multiple platforms now, yada yada.
Therefore Dockers makes many things more easily available for me

Basically, you could consider it to be my pwn shell or smth

## Usage:
```sh
make ctf new # (re-)builds the image and drops you in the container upon completion
make ctf # uses the already built container and drops you in the container
```
